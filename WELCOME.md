# WELCOME

For anyone new to the `vi` world, the arrow keys and the mouse work
here like you're used to. There is one principle to keep in mind, and
vi will make complete sense. Unlike basically every other text program
that normal people use, Vi has `modes`.

NORMAL MODE (where every key is a command - so don't type random stuff!)
INSERT MODE (where you can actually type - input text normally)

`i`      change to `INSERT` mode
`Esc`    exit `INSERT` mode / return to `NORMAL` mode
`:wq`    to write and quit
`:q!`    to quit and don't save
`/`      to start searching for something

`:help`  for online help
`:Tutor` for built in interactive training

# SHORTCUTS

`CTRL+n`: Toggle the "folder tree"
`Tab`: Jump to the next file
`:Telescope keymaps`  to see all of the other keymaps configured
