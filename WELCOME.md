# WELCOME

For anyone new to the `vi` world, the arrow keys and the mouse work
here like you're used to. There is one principle to keep in mind, and
vi will make complete sense. Unlikne basically every other text program
that normal people use, Vi has `modes`.
NORMAL MODE (where you run commands - but can't type) - Every key has a command
INSERT MODE (where you can actually type)

`i`      change to `INSERT` mode (where you can actually type) wherever you are.
`Esc`    exit `INSERT` mode and back to normal mode
`:wq`    to write and quit
`:q!`    to quit and don't save
`/`      to start searching for something

`:help`  for online help
`:Tutor` for built in interactive training

# SHORTCUTS

`CTRL+n`: Toggle the "folder tree"
`Tab`: Jump to the next file
